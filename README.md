# Math for AI Engineering

This is a daily learning log documenting my journey to master the core math skills needed for AI engineering. My current background is early high school level, and this repo tracks my progress as I build toward understanding linear regression and beyond.

## Why this project?

Linear regression in the IBM AI Engineering course was difficult due to missing math foundations. This repo exists to close those gaps.

## Core Areas to Cover
- Algebra & Functions
- Linear Algebra
- Calculus (derivatives & gradients)
- Probability & Statistics

I’ll be learning mainly via Khan Academy, YouTube (3Blue1Brown), and short problem sets.

## Format
Each day, I’ll create a markdown file with:
- Topics studied
- Notes
- Reflections
- Resources used
