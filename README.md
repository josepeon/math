# Math for AI Engineering

This repo documents my daily progress in building the math skills necessary to understand and master AI concepts. I started this after realizing I lacked the foundational knowledge to grasp even early topics like linear regression in the IBM AI Engineering certification.

## Goals
- Build solid intuition in algebra, linear algebra, calculus, and statistics
- Be able to understand machine learning models (regression, gradient descent, etc.)
- Maintain daily GitHub activity and show consistent learning
