# Math for AI Engineering

This repo documents my daily progress in building the math skills necessary to understand and master AI concepts. I started this after realizing I lacked the foundational knowledge to grasp even early topics like linear regression in the IBM AI Engineering certification.

## Goals
- Build solid intuition in algebra, linear algebra, calculus, and statistics
- Be able to understand machine learning models (regression, gradient descent, etc.)
- Maintain daily GitHub activity and show consistent learning

## ✅ 14-Day Math Plan

**Days 1–6**: Algebra 1 — equations, graphing, functions  
**Days 7–9**: Linear Algebra — vectors, matrices, dot products  
**Days 10–12**: Calculus — derivatives, gradients  
**Days 13–14**: Statistics — mean, variance, distributions

## 📆 Daily Log

### 🗓️ Day 1 – First Exposure to Regression (2025-08-02)
- Struggled with linear regression in IBM course
- Took graded quizzes: scored 3/15 for high school level math
- Realized I need to relearn basic algebra, functions, and statistics
- Created this repo to document the journey
